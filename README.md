# BERTrarch

This code is from my Bachelor's thesis back in 2021. The goal was to improve on the Performance of [Petrarch-2](https://github.com/openeventdata/petrarch2). It is a Conflict Event Coding automation software which is based on Standford's [CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/).
This application is based on linguistic syntax constituent trees, one of the earlier approaches of Natural Language Processing. 

We wanted to see how we could improve on the task of Conflict Event Coding using Large Language Models. At the time, Google's [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) was the state of the art in LLMs.

This model is trained and validated on the [ACLED](https://acleddata.com/) and [UCDP](https://ucdp.uu.se/) database to compare the performance on WEIS.
One needs access to the data to run this application. Even then, this was my first project and was never meant to be open source nor used. So you will not find much documentation.
